NumPy is specialist package needed for scientific computing with Python


It provides:
* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities


It is a Python library that is efficient in and cleverly overcomes the problem of running slower algorithms on Python by using multidimensional arrays (lists within lists), matrices and functions that operate on arrays[1].
