# Assigment for Programming For Data Analysis

## An Introduction to the numpy.random package in Python

For this assignment I will investigate the numpy.random package and it's significance in scientific computing in Python. To do this, I will create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the numpy.random package, incuding detailed explainations of at least five distributions
provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks that I will carry out:

- Firstly, I will research and explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package.
- Secondly, I will explain the use of the  "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.
- Thirdly, I will explain the use and purpose of at least 5 "Distributions" functions.
- And lastly, I will explain the use of seeds in generating psuedorandom numbers. 


To run this jupyter notebook file, a Python installation is necessary preferably through Anaconda distribution to benefit from the 720 packages.
To open jupyter notebook, open terminal and on the command line and enter: jupyter notebook, after a few seconds a window will pop up with the notebook.
