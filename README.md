ASSIGNMENT for Programming For Data Analysis

For this assignment I will investigate the numpy.random package and it's significance in scientific computating in Pyhton. To do this, I will create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the numpy.random package, incuding detailed explainations of at least five distributions
provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks that I will carry out:

- Firstly, I will research and explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package.
- Secondly, I will explain the use of the  "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.
- Thirdly, I will explain the use and purpose of at least 5 "Distributions" functions.
- And lastly, I will explain the use of seeds in generating psuedorandom numbers.
